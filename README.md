## Problem Statement and Motivation

### Motivation
- Mental health challenges are widespread, yet many individuals face barriers to accessing professional support due to stigma, cost, and availability. 
- There is a growing need for solutions that are accessible, engaging, and empathetic to support emotional well-being.

### Purpose
To create an interactive, AI-driven mental health application, TalkThru, that provides users with:
- Empathetic conversational support through a chatbot.
- Tools for tracking emotional well-being.

## Methods
- Real-Time Emotion Detection: Utilizing AI models like DistilBERT to analyze user inputs and detect emotional states
- Empathetic Response Generation: Employing models like T5 to generate context-aware, empathetic responses based on detected emotions
- Dynamic Avatar: An avatar that evolves with the userâ€™s emotional progress, providing visual engagement.
- Gamification: Rewarding users for completing self-care tasks to motivate consistent engagement.
